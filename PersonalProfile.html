    <p> Gandalf is an ancient being that is known throughout Middle-Earth. He helped to destroy the One Ring during The War of the Ring. Gandalf was known as a wise person to seek counsel from due to his extensive experience. Upon the destruction of the One Ring, he sailed across the sea to Aman and was never seen again. Even though he left Middle-Earth, he was still well known all throughout the land.</p>
